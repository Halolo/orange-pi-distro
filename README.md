# orange-pi-distro

> :warning: **DEPRECATED**: Most of the drivers for Allwiner SoCs have been [merged in the mainline kernel](https://linux-sunxi.org/Linux_mainlining_effort), and the [meta-sunxi](https://github.com/linux-sunxi/meta-sunxi) yocto layer seems to have recipes to build it, and machine config for most of the SBCs, at least those mentionned in this repo, that's probably where you should look now.

Build images using yocto for:
- [Orange Pi Zero](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizero/) SBC
- [Orange Pi Pc](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepipc/) SBC
- [Orange Pi Pc Plus](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepipcplus/) SBC

## Orange Pi Zero
This will build a minimal console image

Runs the 4.19 mainline kernel

[This XRADIO X819 WiFi driver](https://github.com/fifteenhex/xradio) for mainline kernel is also in the image as a kernel module and loaded at boot time (firmware binaries for this driver come from [here](https://github.com/armbian/build.git))

The SPI NOR flash memory support is enbled in the kernel and bootloader configuration, so it could be used to run u-boot and boot from USB for example

## Orange Pi Pc [Plus]

Runs a [4.17 kernel](https://github.com/megous/linux), with HDMI support and [Mali driver](https://github.com/mripard/sunxi-mali)

It's the r6p2 fb driver and the matching [r6p2 fb user space lib](https://github.com/free-electrons/mali-blobs), to be used with QT using the EGLFS platform (eglfs_mali)

:warning: WIP

The driver is loaded correctly but eglinfo-fb, the qt egl test app and the [sunxi-mali test app](https://github.com/linux-sunxi/sunxi-mali/tree/master/test) fails the same way: segfault in libMali.so

```

## Build the images
Clone the external submodules :

`git submodule update --init`

Source the file `source-me`:

`. source-me <machine>`

With <machine> = "orange-pi-zero", "orange-pi-pc" or "orange-pi-pc-plus"

And build the image:

`bitbake <image>`

With <image> = "opiz-minimal", "opipc-minimal", "opipcplus-minimal" or "opipc-qt5"

## Flash on a sdcard
The rootfs archive, bootloader and kernel images as well as an sdcard image with all needed partitions must have been created in:

`build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<machine>/`

Use dd to flash it on the sdcard (unmount all partitions before):

`dd if=build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<machine>/<image>-<machine>.sunxi-sdimg of=/dev/??? bs=1M`

To create a sdcard with root partition extended to all the device, use this script:

`sudo ./flash-sdcard.sh -d /dev/???`

## Boot
The ethernet network interface is configured as a dhcp client. A sshd is running. Use root for login, no password.

For Orange Pi Zero, The wireless network interface uses wpa_supplicant for its configuration, edit `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf` to setup the ssid and psk. Or run `wpa_passphrase <SSID> <PASSPHRASE> >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf`

## Flash u-boot on the SPI NOR flash (Orange Pi Zero)
If your board has been produced with integrated SPI NOR flash memory, you should see its device file:

`/dev/mtd0`

The distribution provides mtd-utils. Copy the u-boot binary from the image folder on the device:

`scp build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/orange-pi-zero/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin root@<ip>:`

Then, on the device:

`flash_erase /dev/mtd0 0 128`

`flashcp u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin /dev/mtd0`
